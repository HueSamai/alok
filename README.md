# alok

This is a custom allocator I wrote from scratch (no external libraries), dedicated to Alok More. In the mother language, C of course.

Check `alok.h` for more info.

# NOTE

This has not been tested at all really, so don't use it for real projects. 

Also the Makefile doesn't even contain a way to build it into a static or dynamic lib file, so do that yourself I guess lol. Or just put the .c and .h file in your project directly.
